### Inspired by

Inspired by @NielsLeenheer's [TweetPrinter](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BluetoothRocks/TweetPrinter). `bluetooth-printer.js` is loaned directly from the TweetPrinter project and `bundle.js` is generated from https://github.com/Wnt/bluetooth-printer. Basically it contains [Broserified](http://browserify.org/) version of the [esc-pos-encoder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esc-pos-encoder) library and it's dependencies.
